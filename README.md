# TodoList Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)

I developed Todolist frontend using React, TypeScript, Vite and Redux Toolkits.
I didn't use any stylesheet libraries, only my own stylesheet.

How to setup and run:

- `npm install` to download node modules.
- `npm run dev` to run the frontend application.
- Open the web browser and enter `http://localhost:5173` to run the frontend application.
